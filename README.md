# FEM for Gravitaional Potential Differential Equation

This repository contains the solution to given [problem](given%20problem.pdf) (in polish) of solving the gravitational potential differential equation using finite element method (FEM).

It was a part of Differential and Difference Equations Course at AGH UST 2022/2023.

To run the [program](fem.jl) you need [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and Plots package you can download by running commented lines (2-3)

```
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Plots")
```
You can run it in terminal
```
$ julia fem.jl
```
Or you can use code editor e.g. Visual Studio Code with Julia extension

After running the code, you will be asked to pass the number of division points e.g. 10
```
Enter the number of divisions: 10
```
After the necessary calculations, program will display a plot of the function Î¦(x)
